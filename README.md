# FizzBuzzKata in C#

<p>A solution to the classic FizzBuzz Kata.</p> 
<p>This program prints out the numbers 1-100. Numbers that are divisabe by 3 are printed as Fizz. 
Numbers that are divisable by 5 are printed as Buzz.
Numbers that are divisable by 3 and 5 are printed as FizzBuzz. </p>

## Technologies used ##
<p>Language: C#</p>
<p>Testing Framework: MSTest</p>

## My approach ##
I took a TTD approach to solve this kata following the Red-Green-Refactor loop. I have previously completed the FizzBuzz challenge in Ruby and JavaScript. I rewrote this program in C# as a starting point to become familiar with the language and using Microsoft Visual Studio.

## Getting started ##
Clone this repo: </br>
Assuming you are using MVS, open the Program.cs file and run the program using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F5.
